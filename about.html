          particular storyline within the main plot) of which there are
          currently 8 (officially; 9 unofficially; as of December 2017). The

            The journey begins with Gon taking a series of bizarre tests to
            become a Hunter, which includes navigating a deadly jungle, hunting

            underground marathon, and making sushi. During the Hunter Exam, Gon
            meets and befriends three of the applicants, Kurapika, Killua, and
            Leorio. The series' first antagonist is also introduced as one of
            the applicants. Hisoka is a complex villain who uses playing cards

            great pleasure in killing once he's grown up enough to present a
            challenge. Before the end of the Hunter Exam, Killua faces his
            brother, Illumi, who makes him come home before he can even finish

            cash. It is here they meet the Kung-Fu master Wing, who teaches them
            about Nen, a chi-like energy that can be used to manifest superhuman
            powers. He teaches a young child named Zushi, who joins Gon and
            Killua to fight in the tournament to gain money and experience.
            Hisoka is also in the tournament. Gon finally gets to battle Hisoka
            again, to show off how much he has improved.
